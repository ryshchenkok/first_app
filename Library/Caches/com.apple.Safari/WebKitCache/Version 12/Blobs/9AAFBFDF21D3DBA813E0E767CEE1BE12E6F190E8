<pre id="changelist1020684951754796022" style="display: none">Major New Features
------------------
- Deep tmux integration!
  Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network
  failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux
  or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By
  installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to
  iTerm2. When you run tmux with -CC, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or
  tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in
  native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back
  to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane,
  close a window, or open a window (with Shell-&gt;tmux-&gt;new window), that
  action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
  All the details are at https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration

- A "Toolbelt" has been added. It's a drawer that opens to the right of a
  window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and
  lets you open new windows/tabs/splits. Look for the Toolbelt menu.

- Add "triggers." A trigger is an action that is performed when text matching
  some regular expression is received in a terminal session. More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html

- Add "coprocesses." A coprocess is a process, such as a script, that receives
  input from a terminal and whose output is fed into the terminal session as
  though the user were typing it. You can use them to automate interaction with
  scripts, download files with ZModem, and more. More info here:
  http://iterm2.com/coprocesses.html

- You can now edit the smart selection regexes in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced. You can also assign actions that are added to
  the context menu when you right click on text that matches a smart selection
  rule.  More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html

- Support for OS 10.7 features including fullscreen, retina graphics, and
  window restoration.


New Preferences
---------------
- Add support for tiled background images (Foy Savas)
- Add a preference to toggle hiding of the menu bar in non-Lion fullscreen.
  Useful in Mavericks multi-monitor setups.
- Make tabview toggleable in fullscreen.
- Add option to dim background windows.
- Add option to dim only foreground colors.
- Add UI for adjusting dimming amount.
- Add UI to make blur radius configurable.
- Add hidden pref MaxPasteHistoryEntries.
- Add preference to hide tab's activity indicator.
- Add option to draw red stripes in the background to indicate input being sent

- Add preference to disable dimming animation.
- Add option to profiles to send text to shell at startup.
- Add option to disable session-initiated printing.
- Add support for loading prefs from a custom folder (e.g., Dropbox) or URL.
  This makes it easy to share a config between multiple machines or people.
- Add auto logging of sessions. When enabled (per-profile), all input received
  from the host in a session is saved to a file tagged with the window, tag,
  and pane number, plus the time and date of initiation.
- Add next/previous pane action.
- Change around prompt-to-quit options, adding "always/never/only if jobs
  besides ... are running" to profiles-sessions.
- Add option to copy trailing newlines when making a selection that includes a
  whole line at its end.
- Add preference to disable transparency when entering fullscreen mode.
- Improve "Terminal.app Compatibility" key preset to more accurately emulate
  Terminal.
- You can now configure what happens when you cmd-click on a filename in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced.
- Add key action to move tab left/right.
- Add "advanced" directory settings for separate tab, window, and pane settings.
- Add preference for setting locale vars.
- Add preference to disable saving lines to the scrollback buffer while in
  alternate screen mode.
- Add option to always copy preferences to prefs stored in a custom folder.
- Add a new panel to prefs to make mouse actions configurable.

  one row.
- Add hidden option AutocompleteMaxOptions to adjust number of autocomplete
  entries.
- Add hidden option PasteHistoryMaxOptions to adjust number of paste history
  entries.
- Add hidden variable URLCharacterSet that defines characters that are part of
  a URL.
- Disable title reporting unless hidden pref AllowInsecureTitleReporting is set
  to true.
- Add general preference "Adjust window for font size change". Turn it off so
  that the window size stays fixed as the font grows or shrinks (thanks,
  keeyipchan!).
- Add hidden preference PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled to turn off pinch to
  change font size
- Ask for confirmation before deleting a profile.
- Add boolean hidden pref, OpenFileInNewWindows. When you open a file (e.g., a
  shell script) in finder with iTerm2, this controls whether it opens in a new
window or tab.
- Additional window styles: bottom and left of screen.

New Terminal Features
---------------------
- Add support for italics (Stefan Schüßler)
- Change RIS code to move the cursor to the origin (saitoha).
- Convert text to NFC form more aggressively, which should lead to latin
  characters with accents rendering more consistently with certain fonts like
  Inconsolata, which lacks some combining marks.
- Add ITERM_SESSION_ID environment variable that identifiers the window, tab,
  and pane number of each session.
- Add escape code "Esc c" to reset terminal.
- Add new escape code ESC ]6;1;bg;*;default^G to restore tab color to default.
- Add support for reporting focus lost/gained. esc[?1004h turns it on; then the
  terminal sends esc[I when focusing, esc[O when de-focusing. Send esc[?1004l
  to disable.
- Implemented bracketed paste mode (this is cool, see vim script here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585129
- Define VLNEXT and VDISCARD in the term by default.
- Add support for the "screen" terminal's way of setting the window title.
- Support SGR (1006) mouse reporting.

- Add support for OSC 52 (clipboard integration--thanks, saitoha!).
- Add support for DECSCUSR which lets the terminal change the cursor shape and
  blink.
- Add support for DECSTR (esc [!p)

Other Features
--------------
- Improve rendering on glyphs with multiple combining marks.
- When you cmd-click on a filename in a diff, remove the a/ or b/ prefix and
  replace with the real directory to open the file.
- Cmd-opt click on a URL to open it without bringing the browser to the front.
- Improve "send input to all sessions", adding new modes: 1) send to all panes
  in current tab, 2) to all sessions in current window, and 3) to an arbitrary
  collection of panes (toggled with context menu).
- You can toggle send input to all tabs/panes by re-pressing the keystroke that
  got you into that mode.
- Draw a dotted line around maximized sessions.
- Add support for multiple saved window arrangements.

- Make cmd-[ and cmd-] work when a pane is maximized.

  when you have a huge terminal, this makes it easy to quickly find a lost
  cursor. If activated with the shortcut cmd-/, continuing to hold cmd will keep
  the highlighting active.

- Add ability to split a pane by dragging a tab into a terminal session.
- Add "move session to split pane" option to context menu.

- By default, a three-finger click on a trackpad emulates the middle button
  (which by default performs Paste).
- Add ability to change profile from Edit Current Session.
- Change mouse cursor to indicate that mouse reporting is on.
- Add cmd-shift-opt-T to open a new tab using the current session's profile.
- Change default global key bindings to cmd-shift-arrows to move tab left/right.
- Add menu item to move tab left/right.
- Add title bars to split panes that show the title. You can drag panes by
  their titles, and there is a menu and a close button in it as well.
- If no window is open, you can now select multiple items in the profiles and
  window and choose split horizontally/vertically to open a new window with the
  split.
- Add tab colors to view menu and tab context menu (thanks, andreax79)
- Add 'move session to window' context menu item.
- When closing a session, free its scrollback buffer in a background thread to
  avoid hanging.
- Alt-click moves the cursor to the click position.
- Press cmd-9 to go to the last tab.
- Add menu item to toggle broadcasting input to the current pane (make
  pane-by-pane toggling available to focus-follows-mouse users who couldn't
  open a context menu in a deselected pane)
- "Find" continues to search as new text appears.

System Integration
------------------

  space, we only hide the dock and menu when a fullscreen iTerm2 window is on
  the first screen.
- Handle inserting emoji text in mavericks with cmd-ctrl-space.
- Make dock and menu bar appear by moving mouse to top/bottom of screen in
  non-Lion fullscreen mode. Remove hold-cmd-for-tabs.

- Make find text typed in one tab appear in all tabs' find bars.
- App bundle is now signed.
- When a file or folder is dragged onto the dock icon, open it in a new tab
  (not a new window).
- Retina graphics

Proprietary Escape Codes
------------------------
- Add escape code <Esc>]50;SetMark^G to perform Edit > Set Mark command.
- Add escape code to steal focus: ESC ]50;StealFocus^G  (thanks, gordolio).
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;ClearScrollback^G to erase screen and
  scrollback buffer.
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;CurrentDir=/Path/To/Directory^G to notify
  iTerm2 of the current directory (so you can cmd-click on relative filenames
  and we'll know where they are).
- Add proprietary escape code <esc>]50;SetProfile=X^G to set the current
  session's profile to the one named X.- Add proprietary escape code to send
  text to clipboard. To use, send esc]50;CopyToClipboard=X^G followed by text
  followed by esc]50;EndCopy^G, where X is a clipboard name from the set: ruler,
  find, font, or general. If not specified, general is used.
- Add esc]50;RequestAttention=x^G, where if x=1 the dock icon bounces and if
  x=0 it stops.

<pre id="changelist5049160598281157230" style="display: none">The big new feature in iTerm2 version 3.2 is a new rendering
engine that uses Metal 2. It provides much higher drawing
performance. Its availability is subject to some
configuration settings. For details, see
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Metal-Renderer.

New Features
- Metal renderer
- New advanced pref: Open a new window when you click the
  dock icon and no windows are already open?
- New advanced pref: When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled,
  activate the window under the cursor when iTerm2 becomes
  active?
- New advanced pref: Underline Semantic History-selectable
  items under the cursor while holding cmd?
- You can now escape $$ in an Applescript profile command
  with $$$$
- New advanced pref (affecting semantic history's URL
  detection): URLs must contain a scheme?
- Show inline images in retina resolution. On by default in
  beta. In release, enable advanced pref "Show inline images
  at Retina resolution".
- There is a new key binding action to toggle mouse
  reporting.
- Semantic history now recognizes visual studio code-style
  "filename[line, column]" references.
- There's a new type of trigger that turns text into a
   hyperlink.

Bug Fixes
- When you drag a session onto itself in a window with split
  panes, do not move the window.
- Don't allow fullscreen or edge-attached windows to be
  moved with cmd-opt-shift-drag.
- Fix the color picker's eyedropper feature to respect color
  spaces.
- If multiple hotkey windows are open, do not return to the
  previously active app when one is closed.
- When changing the number of lines of scrollback, do not
  apply the change until focus leaves the text field. This
  solves a problem where erasing the value would erase your
  history.
- Scrolling with wheel mice is no longer oversensitive.
- Change behavior of prompt-before-closing for tmux
  integration. Since the list of jobs is not visible, always
  prompt when a whitelist of jobs is specified.
- Fix a bug where changing the cursor shape by escape
  sequence could be reverted by changing any profile
  property.
- When the password manager fails to get a password because
  the system Keychain denied access, show an alert
  explaining what happened.
- Ignore modifier+number when there's no matching
  pane/tab/window to switch to rather than passing it to the
  terminal as a keypress.
- Fix a bug where cmd-0 did not restore the original font
  size in tmux integration.
- Ignore malformed OSC 11.
- Fixes a bug where images could be drawn in the wrong
  column.
- Improved behavior of Yen key sending backslash for
  Japanese keyboards.
- "Select Current Command" works while the command
   is running
- Fix a bug where the offer to turn off paste bracketing
  didn't actually turn off paste bracketing.

Other improvements
- When not in alternate screen mode, tab will change the
  background color of cells the cursor skipped over. This
  violates tradition but is more sensible behavior for
  printing syntax-highlighted code with tabs.
- Inset marks by one pixel on the left margin.
- The rendering of faint text has been changed to take the
  background color into account.
- The toolbelt tools look nicer in the dark schemes.
- The pointing hand cursor will show only while over a
  clickable item while holding cmd.
- Tab name truncation no longer takes a parenthesized (job)
  name at the end into account when deciding whether to
  truncate the head or tail.
- Performance improvements.

- The setting "Open tmux windows as tabs in existing

  windows you create after attaching. The old behavior
  prevented you from creating unattached windows in tmux
  integration mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix a bug that caused iTerm2 to hang when using the
  Metal renderer
- Fix a few crashes
- Temporarily disable the Metal renderer while a view is
  being resized to avoid seeing it stretched.
- Fix support for double-struck bold text in the Metal
  renderer.
- Fix a bug where new windows would draw incorrectly
  sometimes when using the Metal renderer.
- Turn off Metal renderer when Find or Paste views are
  open because they don't always composite correctly.

New Features:
- Add an advanced setting to disable wraparound in
  directional split pane navigation.
- Add an advanced setting that allows TAB codes to wrap
  around to the next line. This is useful to preserve
  tabs for text you plan to paste but could break
  backward compatibility.

  tab.

This release features support for a new GPU-based renderer.
It's off by default, but if you're feeling brave, you can
turn it on in advanced prefs. For more info, see here:

https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Metal-Renderer

New Features:
- Off-by-default high performance renderer
- Add support for REP escape sequence. This is on by default
  only for Beta and Nightly build users.
- Added "Edit Session" to the tab context menu.
- Add buried sessions to status bar icon menu.
- Add option to suppress restart session confirmation.
- Sort files in Scripts menu.
- Add support for OSC 10 and OSC 11 (color querying).

Other improvements:
- Unicode 9 widths are now on by default for High Sierra
  users. This could cause problems for you if you ssh to a
  machine that doesn't have support for this (such as a Mac
  with an older OS, various Linuxes, etc.)
- Improve the touch bar icon for adding a mark.
- Update Solarized color presets to exactly match the
  official spec with SRGB colors.
- Add menu item to show third party licenses.
- Improved support for tab colors with tmux integration.
- Don't make the window under the mouse active when focus
  follows mouse is on and you switch to another app and then
  back to iTerm2 and the mouse hasn't moved.
- Improve naming of modifier+number menu items in
  Prefs>Keys.
- Improve support for images wider than 256 columns.
- Only show key icon in terminal with keyboard focus.
- Disable smart cursor color when a non-box cursor type is
  selected.
- Improve performance of opening a window with the Profiles
  tool present when there are many profiles.
- Rate limit changes to window title.
- Limit max length of tab and window titles for performance.
- When the window is very narrow and you are resizing it
  show only the geometry in the title.
- Allow focus follows mouse to select non-hotkey windows
  when a hotkey window has focus provided it's not an
  auto-hiding hotkey window

Bug Fixes:

- Fixes a bug where windows would disappear when switching displays.

Enhancements:
- Changes the shortcut for bury session to cmd-opt-shift-B so it's
  harder to do by accident.

- Use secure copy to download files selected with cmd-click on a
  filename on a remote host and OSC 8 URLs with a file: scheme and a
  host part.
- You can now enable ligatures on any font, not only those in a
  whitelist. Your font may not have ligatures, in which case this will
  just hurt performance with no benefit.

  proto file.

  different profiles and to base the profile of the tmux sessions on the
  session that attached to tmux.

- Fix a bug where the order of windows in applescript was random, not
  back to front.

<pre id="changelist1657437833329922804" style="display: none">New features:
- Add support for OSC 8 to do hypertext links. The syntax is:
  OSC 8 ; params ; url ST
    params is zero or more colon-delimited key=value strings. The only
  defined key is "id". Two adjacent hyperlinks with the same URL but
  different "id"s will not highlight together on hover. id is
  optional.
    As usual, OSC is 'esc ]' and st is 'esc \'.
- Trigger highlighting colors in a dynamic profile may use #rrggbb
  notation.
- Semantic history can now open file:line:column in VSCode.
- Change "Open in current space" for hotkey windows to move the hotkey
  window to the current space if it's already open on another space
  when the hotkey is pressed.
- Add an advanced pref to tweak the height of the underline cursor.
- Add an experimental feature to draw an outline around underline and
  vertical bar cursors to improve distinction from text.

Bug fixes:
- Add a send text request to the experimental API server
- Add an advanced pref to use full-height cursor (including vertical
  padding area)
- Draw underline and vertical line cursor behind text to
  improve readability.
- Update to Sparkle 1.17 (with iTerm2-specific patches)
- The first time the tmux gateway is auto-buried, open the
  sessions menu and point out how to restore it with a popover hanging
  off an invisible high-level window.
- Prevent marks from getting absurdly wide when margins are
  increased well beyond their defaults.
- Add a clear button to captured output tool.
- Fix a truly terrible memory leak.
- Fix a bug where double-tap of a modifier didn't work to open a
  hotkey window if it didn't also have a regular shortcut.
- Fix a leak of inline images.
- Fix a bug where sessions aren't restored correctly if the number of
  scrollback lines is small.
- Fix a bug where the find cursor UI would not be removed if you
  switched sessions while it was open.
- Improve performance in neovim by ensuring the display updates more
  regularly.
- Give scrollers a light appearance when the window has a dark
  appearance so they'll be visible.
- There's a hack to make the app active when the space changes
  to a lion fullscreen window and the app isn't active. This is needed
  only for LSUIElement apps, where the OS gets confused. Limit the
  hack to LSUIElement mode since you could use spaces and have two
  monitors.
- Use SRGB for OSC 6 ; 1 ; bg ; red ; brightness ; Pc ST. It
  was unstable before because I'd set the value in calibrated and then
  convert it to SRGB when modifying a different component.
- 6f9ab24 Don't crash on OSC 7 with bad URL.
- Fix a bug where we incorrectly removed the tab color from
  non-tmux sessions. It should have removed the tab color from tmux
  sessions that have one in the tmux profile but not in the saved
  session state.
- Handle ligatures in Firacode better if had previously turned off
  ligatures in a different ligature font.

Lots of bug fixes and some teeny new features. Release notes now include the
SHA-256 of the zip file. This is a follow up to the short-lived version
2.9.20160422, which had some crashing bugs.

- Fix two crashes that happened frequently in versions of OS X 10.10 and older
  (failure to remove an observer and use of a 10.11 API)

The following changes were also in 2.9.20160422:

Updates:
- Update libssh to version 1.7 to fix a crash when public key authentication
  fails.
- Update to the latest version of Sparkle, version 1.14.

Major bug fixes:
- Fix a memory leak.
- Fix a crash when changing the number of displays.
- Fix a crash when there is no general pasteboard.
- Improve performance when a tmux window has a lot of tabs.
- Setting the background image via an escape sequence is now disabled when the
  terminal is marked untrusted in advanced prefs.
- Make the scure input menu item indicate the true state of secure input, even
  if another app has turned it on.
- Remember the width that the tab bar was dragged to when it's on the left.

New Features:
- Add regular expression substitution to the advanced paste window.
- Offer to install utilities (currently imgcat and it2dl, which downloads
  files) when you install shell integration.
- Add a new custom escape sequence. OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize ST will respond
  with OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize= H ; W ST where H and W are floating point
  values giving the height and width of a cell, respectively.
- Parse /etc/auto_master to find NFS automounts and ignore them for semantic
  history because they tend to be slow to statfs().
- Add Select Current Command to the Edit menu. It selects the command at the
  current command line. It requires that Shell Integration be installed.
- Set TERM_SESSION_ID and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION for compatibility with
  Terminal.app's standard.

Improvements to Automatic Profile Switching:
- Fix a bug where Automatic Profile Switching rules were scored incorrectly.
  Longer rules now outrank shorter rules ceteris paribus, as they always should
  have.
- Add support for "sticky" Automatic Profile Switching rules. A sticky rule
  begins with ! and will stay in effect after its rules no longer match
(provided no other APS rule matches).
- Add support for wildcards in path names in Automatic Profile Switching rules.

Visual Improvements:
- Modernize the look of the Open Quickly window.
- Improve the visual appearance of inactive tabs with colors.
- Left-align tab labels when the tab bar is on the left.
- Add high-contrast themes.

New Preferences:
- Add a checkbox to Window preferences to make non-default background colors
  always opaque.
- Add an advanced preference to disable dictionary lookup on force press.
- Add an advanced preference to specify directories to ignore for semantic
  history.
- Add an off-by-default advanced preference to redraw the screen after Clear
  Buffer is selected.
- Add an advanced preference that makes cmd-click invoke semantic history even
  when iTerm2 is not the active app.

Minor bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where open quickly would not search the names of sessions that had
  been renamed in Get Info.
- Improve how the bold version of your font is chosen.
- Fix a bug where non-anti-aliased underlines were too thick.
- Change how the view is redrawn. It now redraws 30 times per second when
  active. Previously it did some really complicated, poorly understood, and
  probably buggy things with adaptive rates.
- Fix a bug where the hamburger menu's Restart Session item would restart the
  tab's current session, not the session associated with the menu.
- Improve signal handling for shells without job control by making the session
  retoration server a process group leader.
- Fix a bug where trying to tmux -CC attach to a tmux server without a session
  would cause us to write a command to the shell prompt.
- Fix a bug where the activity indicator in a tab wouldn't appear with a dark
  theme, sometimes.
- Reduce CPU usage in certain cases by not drawing tab labels and computing
  their sizes excessively.
- Improve predictability of restoring the default window arrangement.
- Fix a bug where user names were not properly escaped as an argument to login.
- Fix a bug where moving a selection's endpoint by one character with the
  keyboard would move it by two sometimes.
- Fix a bug in how selected text is reported to accessibility.
- Fix a bug where option-click to move the cursor didn't handle double-width
  characters properly.
- Fix a bug where an unterminated DCS code would cause output to be consumed
  indefinitely. Now we stop when we get a control character besides ESC or
  non-ASCII text.
- Pass -q to login if ~/.hushlogin exists. Fixes an issue where open a session
  in a directory other than your home directory would not respect hushlogin.
- Improve the appearance of top-right indicators when timestamps are being
  drawn.
- Allow windows without a title bar to be miniaturized.
- Fix the colors of Advanced Preferences when the preferences panel is not key.
- Fix a bug where right mouse clicks were reported incorrectly.
- Update TextMate's bundle identifier for the new version with captial letters.
- Make the custom escape sequence SetBackgroundImageFile with an empty name
  remove the background image.
- Fix a bug where launching Atom with shell integration would open two files.
- Fix a bug where the current prompt loses the link to its mark when a window
  is resized with bash.
- Improve the visual appearance of marks, especially with larger fonts.
- Highlight marks in red when they have an error code when navigating to them.
- Make the confirmation click prompt to disable tip of the day more noticeable.

<pre id="changelist144023035080955779" style="display: none">tl;dr: Lots of bugs fixed. Significant changes to automatic profile swiitching.
Miscellaneous small new features added.

Major Changes:
- Change how Automatic Profile Switching to keep a stack of profiles. When no
  APS rule is matches the current state, we pop profiles from the stack until it
  has only one or we find one whose rule matches.
- Update to libssh2 version 1.7.0. Fixes a bug where known_hosts entries got
  clobbered and adds new algorithms.

New Prefs:
- Add an advanced setting to disable escape sequences that could be misused by
  untrusted content. Issue 4229.
- Add a new advanced setting to control how many bytes of context are used in
  semantic history. Issue 4399.

Updates to Semantic History:
- Treat IP addresses and hostnames with at least two components as URLs for
  semantic history. Issue 4281.
- When opening a file from semantic history, if no app is able to handle opening
  the file offer the user the option to pick an app and associate it as the
  default viewer. Issue 4281.
- Strip enclosing parentheses, angle brackets, square brackets, apostrophes, and
  quotes from filenames in sementic history (used to be just parens).

Other Improvements:
- Left-side tab bar can now be dragged wider or narrower. Issue 4270.
- When dragging a file to upload with scp into iTerm2, indicate the various drop
  targets' username, hostname, and destination directory.

  strip the trailing newline.
- Rename the trigger action 'Set Directory' and 'Set Host and User' to reduce
  confusion. Allow 'Report Host and User' to report only the host ("@hostname")
  or only the user ("username@").
- Replace \n and \xXX in the badge with newline and an ascii value.
- Add a "Don't Ask Again" option to the offer to restart a session.
- Show a warning when we fail to connect to a remote host for scp with a help
  button that takes you to the wiki article explaining how to fix it.
- If you enter a query beginning with "/a", "/f", "/p", or "/t" in the Open
  Quickly window then results are restricted to window arrangements, searching
  sessions, switching profiles, and opening tabs, respectively.
- Automatically detect when you're tryiing to use the scroll wheel to move
  through a document in alternate screen mode and offer to change the setting.
- Add support for a custom CSI code: CSI 1337 n. We'll report a string of 'CSI
  ITERM2 versionnumber n'. This is useful for detecting that iTerm2 version 3 is
  running in a way that's compatible with other terminals.

Big Bugs Fixed:
- Fix a bug where automatic profile switching didn't work in fullscreen.
- Fix a bug where moving a horizontal splitter would sometimes not work.

- Fix a bug where Do Not Remap key actions didn't work. Issue 4284.

Little Bugs Fixed:

  into its own window's tab bar caused the window to close. Issue 4189.
- Fix misalginment of tab close button when pressed.
- Fix various memory leaks.
- Make terminal first responder after double-clicking in command history.
- Fix a bug where windows restored at startup into fullscreen wouldn't have
  blurred backgrounds when fullscreen was exited. Issue 4269.
- Don't check the nonstandard file ~/.ssh/ssh_config for scp transfers. Issue
  3690.
- Make a reset (by Cmd-R) of the terminal restore the cursor guide to its state
  as specified by the profile, not always off. Issue 4272
- Fix a bug where renaming a profile while the profile list view is sorted
  alphabetically would change the selected profile. Issue 4085.
- Don't make a hidden hotkey window key when the app becomes active, focus
  follows mouse is on, and the mouse happens to be over the frame of the hotkey
  window. Issue 4260.
- Fix a bug where the pencil icon would not appear if growl notifications were
  off. Issue 4255.

- When you Undo Close a session with a broken pipe, show the offer to restart
  it.
- Fix a bug where the butter bar views leaked.
- Fix a bug where the broken pipe red lines would disappear sometimes.

  well) composed of more than one ideograph didn't select the full word on
  double click. Issue 4325.
- Don't draw the same timestamp over and over on consecutive lines. Indicate
  repeating timestamps with a double line. Increase the alpha value of the
  timestamp background to 90%. Issue 4333.
- Fix a bug where Search fields in the toolbelt would try to autocomplete for
  some users.

This is the recommended beta build for most users. It has major changes over 2.1.1. <a href="/version3.html">Learn all about the iTerm2 version 3 beta release</a>.

<pre id="changelist6009354198115375467" style="display: none">There are a lot of new features in the version 3.0 beta release. It represents
about eighteen months of development. These are just the highlights.

- iTerm2 has been updated for the new Mac OS X Yosemite flat look and is
  stunningly beautiful.

- Shell Integration is a modification to your shell's login script that informs
  iTerm2 of which commands you're running, which host you're logged in to, what
  your user name is, and what your current directory is. This enables all kinds
  of cool features, such as easily navigating to preceding shell prompts,
  getting a notification when a long-running job finishes, drag-dropping files
  to upload and download on remote hosts, and much more. All the details are at
  the <a href="/shell_integration.html">Shell Integration</a> document.

- Session Restoration allows your jobs to keep running after iTerm2 upgrades, is
  force-quit, or crashes. It's like tmux without tmux! Note that this is off by
  default but <a href="https://iterm2.com/restoration.html">it can be enabled in
  advanced settings</a>.

- Using the <a href="/imgcat">imgcat</a> script, iTerm2 can display image files
  right in the terminal--even animated GIFs. See the <a
  href="/images.html">Inline Images</a> document for details.

- The built-in Password Manager saves you from having to remember lots of
  passwords. It uses Mac OS's keychain to securely store them, and has built-in
  guards to prevent them from being accidentally transmitted when not at a
  password prompt. You can even write a Trigger that automatically opens the
  Password Manager at the password prompt.

- Undo closing sessions, tabs, and windows. If you close a session by accident,
  you get five seconds to hit Cmd-Z to undo it.

- Have lots of tabs? Put the tab bar on the left. Quickly search them by recent
  commands, directories, current host name, profile name, and more with the Open
  Quickly feature.

- Dynamic Profiles allow you to store profiles in JSON files. This is really
  handy if you have lots of profiles or want to auto-generate them. See the
  <a href="/dynamic-profiles.html">Dynamic Profiles</a> document for details.

- Never lose your cursor. An optional cursor guide highlights the entire row
  your cursor is on and Cursor Boost dims all colors other than the cursor to
  make it really stand out.

- Performance is greatly improved by parsing the incoming bytes off the main
  thread. Hundreds of bugs have been fixed. Lots of details have been improved:
  for example, if you print a binary file to the console, you're offered the
  option to silence the bell. You can edit strings before you paste them.  You get
  warned before pasting tabs at your shell prompt. And much more!
